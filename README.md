# Dislocated
A chat site built by me and some friends.
We got fed up with discord being blocked by our school's internet so we decided to build our own.

We have already hosted the service and it is public for anyone to use <a href="https://dislocated.000webhostapp.com">here</a>.
I decided to put it on github as an open source project so feel free to copy code, just credit me with the original.
Just as I would like you to credit me, I would like to credit ScaleDrone with the base code for the chat and for hosting the message server.
I will try to update this as much as I can.

Known bugs:<br>
Userlist is pretty broken.<br>
Messages sometimes don't show up<br>
